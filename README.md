# windows_bin

The files I keep in my Windows bin folder.

cmd | desc
--- | ----
**bashrc** | echo "source bin/bashrc" >> ~/.bashrc
**condarc** | Load into conda somehow, see "conda info"
**drmi** | Purge dead Docker images
**killnode** | Kill the node.exe processes leftover by parcel.
**open** | An attempt to make 'open' work like it does in MacOS.
**uptime** | Something to say when Brian compulsively types "uptime".

## Release notes

This repo was handy so I am using it to test 
building a release and attaching an asset to it.

I want the release file to container the list of bins and this README.md

I want it to be downloadable as a zip file from a fixed location.

[Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5207269/how-to-release-a-build-artifact-asset-on-github-with-a-script)
are instructions on how to do a release, including an asset file.
